### Docker Basics



###### Start Docker Daemon?

```bash
service docker start
```

###### How to understand container?

- To deploy an app(e.g. Java app), we used to check the OS is identical, install right jdk and so on. Overall, enviroment is complex. What if we put everything we need(OS,Jdk,Tomcat...) together, make them as an image, so this image can be transferred to everywhere, and run it easily.
